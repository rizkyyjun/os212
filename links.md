 A complete guide for learning basic of c language. This website will helps us understand c language easily.

## Week 03
1. [File Systems in Operating System](https://www.guru99.com/file-systems-operating-system.html)<br/>
 Artikel ini menyediakan informasi-informasi yang kita butuhkan untuk mengerti file systems pada sistem operasi, disajikan secara ringkas dan menggunakan bahasa yang ringan membuat artikel ini menjadi mudah untuk dimengerti. Artikel ini menurut saya seperti rangkuman dari materi textbook chapter 13.

2. [An Introduction to Linux filesystems](https://opensource.com/life/16/10/introduction-linux-filesystems)<br/>
 This article give us guide to understand filesystems concept in linux operating systems, covers information about definition, functions, structure, types, and mounting.

3. [Files & File Systems Concept](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN8YgJnShPM&t=389s)<br/>
 This video give us information about how file work and how computers keep them all organized with file systems.

## Week 04
1. [Pointers in C Programming](https://www.guru99.com/c-pointers.html)<br/>
 This article shows informations about pointers in C, including information about how to use and how to initialize it. It also explain about types of pointers in C and type of access pointers in C (direct and indirect). I think this website is helpful because it covers all information that i need to understand basic of pointers in C.

2. [Pointers in C course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuegQmMdy8M)<br/>
 I think this video is a complete guide to understand pointers in C. It cover information about basic of pointers in C and also memory allocation concept in C. I think this video would be helpful for us to understand pointers in C.

3. [Dynamic memory allocation in C](https://www.javatpoint.com/dynamic-memory-allocation-in-c)<br/>
 This website explain dynamic memory allocation concepts in C. From this website, i know that dynamic memory allocation enables programmer to allocate memory at runtime. It also shows information about difference between static and dynamic memory allocation and information about functions or methods that used for dynamic memory allocation in c, such as `malloc()`, `calloc()`, `realloc()`, and `free()`.

4. [Dynamic memory allocation and fragmentation in C](https://www.design-reuse.com/articles/25090/dynamic-memory-allocation-fragmentation-c.html)<br/>
 This article provide systematic information about dynamic memory allocation and fragmentation in C. I believe that it would be helpful to make us understand about these concept because the explanation is clear, simple and systematic.

## Week 05
1. [Virtual Memory Concept in Operating System](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_virtual_memory.htm)<br/>
 This page is talk about virtual memory in operating system, including the definition of virtual memory and also advantage and disadvantage of virtual memory. This page is also provide information about 3 page replacement algorithms that used in virtual memory, such as First In First Out (FIFO), Optimal, and Least Recently Used (LRU). I believe that it would be helpful to make us understand about virtual memory because the explanation is clear and to the point.

2. [Another Virtual Memory Concept in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/virtual-memory-in-operating-system/)<br/>
 This article provide information about virtual memory in operating system, including topic of demand paging, page fault, swapping, and trashing. So, this page will help us to understand further topic about virtual memory in operating system.

3. [Page Replacement Algorithms in Virtual Memory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHu-8IQ97AQ&list=PL21TusoIkLo8nLC2wdibOhhYwrdXWnulT&index=7)<br/>
 This video explain about 3 page replacement algorithms in virtual memory with example of how to use these algorithms. I believe that it would be helpful for us to understand how page replacement algorithm works in virtual memory so it'll help us to answer previous midterm problems on file 200.pdf.

## Week 06
1. [fork() in c](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/fork-in-c-programming-language/)<br/>
 This article mostly talk about fork() function in c. The content is complete enough to help us understand how fork() function work in c, this article also provide several examples of fork() function with a sketch visualization that helpful for us.

2. [fork() docs](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fork.2.html)<br/>
 Linux manual page about fork() function (fork() function documentations). This page provide complete information about fork() function just like all of the other documentation. I believe it would be helpful to make us understand fork() function further. 

3. [Summary of Processes in Operating System](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/3_Processes.html)<br/>
 This article provide informations about processes in OS just like chapter 3 in text book, but using a simple explanation so it make us easier to understand this topic.

4. [Threads and Concurrency](https://applied-programming.github.io/Operating-Systems-Notes/3-Threads-and-Concurrency/#why-are-threads-useful) and [Difference between Process and Thread](https://www.guru99.com/difference-between-process-and-thread.html)<br/>
 The first one is article that explains about thread and concurrency, the explanations is clear and understandable and  also provide a lot of visualization, so would be helpful for us to understand these topics and the second one is article that mostly talk about process and the difference between process and thread. From this article i know that process means any program is in execution, while thread means a segment of a process. This article point out the difference using a lot of parameters, so i believe that it would be helpful for us. 

## Week 07
1. [Process Synchronization in Operating Systems](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/process-synchronization)<br/>
 This article explain about process synchronization in os, just like textbook chapter 6, it also explain about race condition and several solution to face critical solution problem. It'll help us to understand our weekly topic.

2. [Intro to Deadlock in OS](https://www.guru99.com/deadlock-in-operating-system.html)<br/>
 This article give us information about deadlock. From this page i know that deadlock is a situation when any process enters a waiting state because another waiting process is holding the demain resource, and deadlock is common problem in multiprocessing, when there are several process happen concurrently. The explanations are clear and understandable, it also comes with simple explanation and visualization to makes us understand this topic.

3. [Visualization of race condition and how to solve it using Dekker's Algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqnpIwN7dz0)<br/>
 This video comes with great visualization about race condition. It really help me to understand and visualize race condition in os when there are two programs that try to access data at the same time (concurrent).
